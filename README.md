## About Project

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

-   [Simple, fast routing engine] Home Page.
-   [Simple, fast routing engine] User Page.
-   Frontend Tamplate
-   User Dashboard
-   User Profile
-   User Post
-   Blog Search
-   Blog view
-   Blog view -> Details
-   Admin Dashboard
-   User Manage
-   Blog Manage
-   Post Manage
-   Tag Manage

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
